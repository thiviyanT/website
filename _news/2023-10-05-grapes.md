A new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03399">preprint</a> on <i>GRAPES: Learning to Sample Graphs for Scalable Graph Neural Networks</i> is now available on arXiv. GRAPES is a GFlowNet-based sampling approach that selects crucial nodes for a given downstream task, enabling GNNs to scale to large graphs.
