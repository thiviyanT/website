title: "Dagstuhl Proposal"
---

Our <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en">Dagstuhl Seminar</a> proposal, titled *“A Roadmap Towards Practical Applications of Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning”*, has been accepted!  In this proposal, we discussed the current limitations and assumptions of NeSy systems, categorising them into six different key challenges. The Dagstuhl seminar will bring together researchers to discuss these challenges and put together a roadmap to address them. I enjoyed working on this proposal with Annette ten Teije, Tarek Besold, Leilani Gilpin, and Kristian Kersting.
