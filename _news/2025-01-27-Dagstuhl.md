title: "Dagstuhl Proposal"

Our Dagstuhl Seminar proposal, titled “A Roadmap Towards Practical Applications of Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning,” has been accepted! The seminar will gather researchers to address six key challenges in NeSy systems and develop a roadmap to overcome them. I enjoyed collaborating on this proposal with Annette ten Teije, Tarek Besold, Leilani Gilpin, and Kristian Kersting.
