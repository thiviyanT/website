Last week, I attended the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nesy2023">NeSy 2023 workshop</a> which was hosted at the beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certosa_di_Pontignano">Certosa di Pontignano</a> in Siena, Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹. It was a perfect blend of networking and diving deeper into the fascinating world of NeSy research.
